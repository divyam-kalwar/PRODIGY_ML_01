# House Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features related to residential properties, and the target variable is the sale price of the houses.

# Dataset Description
train.csv: The training set
test.csv: The test set
data_description.txt: Full description of each column
sample_submission.csv: Benchmark submission from a linear regression on specific features
# Data Fields
Here is a brief overview of the columns in the dataset:

SalePrice: The property's sale price in dollars (target variable)
MSSubClass: Building class
MSZoning: General zoning classification
LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property
... (and many more)
# Exploring the Data
The Python script uses libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to load and explore the dataset. The initial analysis involves checking data shapes, missing values, and basic statistics.

# Cleaning the Data
The script handles missing values, converting categorical features, and imputing numerical features using techniques like KNN imputation. It also performs outlier treatment and feature engineering to create new meaningful features.

# Feature Transformation
Skewed numerical features are log-transformed, and a cosine transform is applied to cyclic features like months to enhance model performance.

# Model Selection
Several machine learning models are explored, including CatBoostRegressor, BayesianRidge, LGBMRegressor, Ridge, and OrthogonalMatchingPursuit. The script uses techniques such as Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.

# Bagging Ensemble
The script creates an ensemble of models, including CatBoost, BayesianRidge, LGBMRegressor, Ridge, and OrthogonalMatchingPursuit, to improve predictive performance.

# Evaluation
The models are evaluated using cross-validation, and R-squared scores are calculated. The final predictions are generated by combining the predictions from different models.

# Submission
The predictions are then saved in a CSV file named "submission.csv," which can be submitted to a competition or used for further analysis.
